                "description": "Prader\u2013Willi syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by a loss of function of specific genes on chromosome 15. In newborns, symptoms include weak muscles, poor feeding, and slow development. Beginning in childhood, those affected become constantly hungry, which often leads to obesity and type 2 diabetes. Mild to moderate intellectual impairment and behavioral problems are also typical of the disorder. Often, affected individuals have a narrow forehead, small hands and feet, short height, and light skin and hair. Most are unable to have children.",
                "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prader%E2%80%93Willi_syndrome",
                "symptoms": "PWS symptoms can range from poor muscle tone during infancy to behavioral problems in early childhood. Some symptoms often found in infants, besides poor muscle tone, are a lack of eye coordination; almond-shaped eyes; thin upper lip; and, due to poor muscle tone, lack of a strong sucking reflex. Their cries are weak, and they have difficulty waking up.\n\nMore aspects seen in a clinical overview include hypotonia and abnormal neurologic function, hypogonadism, developmental and cognitive delays, hyperphagia and obesity, short stature, and behavioral and psychiatric disturbances.\n\nThe following features and signs are indicators of PWS, although not all will be present:\n\nIn-utero and birth\nReduced fetal movement\nFrequent abnormal fetal position\nOccasional polyhydramnios (excessive amniotic fluid)\nOften breech or caesarean births\nLethargy\nHypotonia\nFeeding difficulties (due to poor muscle tone affecting sucking reflex)\nDifficulties establishing respiration\nHypogonadism\nChildhood\nDelayed milestones/intellectual delay\nExcessive sleeping\nStrabismus (crossed eyes)\nScoliosis (often not detected at birth)\nCryptorchidism\nSpeech delay\nPoor physical coordination\nHyperphagia (excessive hunger) begins between the ages of 2 and 8, and continues throughout adulthood.\nExcessive weight gain\nSleep disorders\nDelayed puberty\nShort stature\nObesity\nExtreme flexibility\nNarrow forehead at the temples\nNarrow nose bridge\nThin upper lip\nDownturned mouth\nUnusually fair hair, skin and eyes\nSmall hands and feet\nTooth decay owing to underproduction of saliva\nConstipation or swollen stomachs owing to poor muscle tone in the gut\nLow levels of HGH\nAdulthood\nInfertility (males and females)\nHypogonadism\nSparse pubic hair\nObesity\nHypotonia (low muscle tone)\nLearning disabilities/borderline intellectual functioning (but some cases of average intelligence)\nProne to type 2 diabetes mellitus\nExtreme flexibility\nPhysical appearance\nProminent nasal bridge\nSmall hands and feet with tapering of fingers\nSoft skin, which is easily bruised\nExcess fat, especially in the central portion of the body\nHigh, narrow forehead\nThin top lip\nDownturned mouth\nAlmond-shaped eyes\nLight skin and hair relative to other family members\nLack of complete sexual development\nFrequent skin picking\nStretch marks\nDelayed motor development\nNeurocognitive\nIndividuals with PWS are at risk of learning and attention difficulties. Curfs and Fryns (1992) conducted research into the varying degrees of learning disability found in PWS.\n\nCassidy found that 40% of individuals with PWS have borderline/low average intelligence, a figure higher than the 32% found in Curfs and Fryns' study. However, both studies suggest that most individuals (50\u201365%) fall within the mild/borderline/low average intelligence range.[citation needed]\n\nChildren with PWS show an unusual cognitive profile. They are often strong in visual organization and perception, including reading and vocabulary, but their spoken language (sometimes affected by hypernasality) is generally poorer than their comprehension. A marked skill in completing jigsaw puzzles has been noted, but this may be an effect of increased practice.\n\nAuditory information processing and sequential processing are relatively poor, as are arithmetic and writing skills, visual and auditory short-term memory, and auditory attention span. These sometimes improve with age, but deficits in these areas remain throughout adulthood.\n\nPWS may be associated with psychosis.\n\nBehavioral\nPWS is frequently associated with a constant insatiable appetite, which persists no matter how much the patient eats, often resulting in morbid obesity.  Caregivers need to strictly limit the patients' access to food, usually by installing locks on refrigerators and on all closets and cabinets where food is stored. It is the most common genetic cause of morbid obesity in children. Currently, no consensus exists as to the cause for this symptom, although genetic abnormalities in chromosome 15 disrupt the normal functioning of the hypothalamus. Given that the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus regulates many basic processes, including appetite, a link may well exist. In the hypothalamus, nerve cells that produce oxytocin, a hormone thought to contribute to satiety, are believed to be abnormal in people with PWS.\n\nPeople with PWS have high ghrelin levels, which are thought to contribute directly to the increased appetite, hyperphagia and obesity seen in this syndrome. Cassidy states the need for a clear delineation of behavioral expectations, the reinforcement of behavioural limits, and the establishment of regular routines.\n\nThe main mental-health difficulties experienced by people with PWS include compulsive behaviour (usually manifested in skin picking) and anxiety. Psychiatric symptoms, for example, hallucinations, paranoia and depression, have been described in some cases and affect about 5\u201310% of young adults.  Patients are also often extremely stubborn and prone to anger. Psychiatric and behavioural problems are the most common cause of hospitalization.\n\nTypically 70\u201390% of affected individuals develop behavioral patterns in early childhood. Aspects of these patterns can include stubbornness, temper tantrums, controlling and manipulative behavior, difficulty with change in routine and compulsive-like behaviors.\n\nEndocrine\nSeveral aspects of PWS support the concept of a growth hormone deficiency. Specifically, individuals with PWS have short stature, are obese with abnormal body composition, have reduced fat-free mass, have reduced lean body mass and total energy expenditure, and have decreased bone density. PWS is characterized by hypogonadism. This is manifested as undescended testes in males and benign premature adrenarche in females. Testes may descend with time or can be managed with surgery or testosterone replacement. Adrenarche may be treated with hormone replacement therapy.[citation needed]\n\nOphthalmologic\nPWS is commonly associated with development of strabismus. In one study, over 50% of patients had strabismus, mainly esotropia.\n\nSome individuals (often those with deletions) may have hypopigmented fundi due to OCA2 haploinsufficiency.",

                "description": "Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a chronic functional condition of unknown pathogenesis. CVS is characterized as recurring episodes lasting a single day to multiple weeks. Each episode is divided into four phases: inter-episodic, prodrome, vomiting, and recovery. Inter-episodic phase, is characterized as no discernible symptoms, normal everyday activities can occur, and this phase typically lasts one week to one month. The prodrome phase is known as the pre-emetic phase, characterized by the initial feeling of an approaching episode, still able to keep down oral medication. Emetic or vomiting phase is characterized as intense persistent nausea, and repeated vomiting typically lasting hours to days. Recovery phase is typically the phase where vomiting ceases, nausea diminishes or is absent, and appetite returns. \"Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a rare abnormality of the neuroendocrine system that affects 2% of children.\" This disorder is thought to be closely related to migraines and family history of migraines.",
                "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_vomiting_syndrome",
                "symptoms": "Affected individuals may vomit or retch 6\u201312 times in an hour and an episode may last from a few hours to over three weeks and in some cases months, with a median episode duration of 41 hours. Stomach acid, bile and, if the vomiting is severe, blood may be vomited. Some with the condition will ingest water to reduce the irritation of bile and acid on the esophagus during emesis. Between episodes, the affected individual is usually normal and healthy otherwise but can be in a weak state of fatigue or experience muscle pain. In approximately half of cases the attacks, or episodes, occur in a time-related manner. Each attack is stereotypical; that is, in any given individual, the timing, frequency and severity of attacks is similar. Some affected people experience episodes that progressively get worse when left untreated, occurring more frequently with reduced symptom free phase.\n\nEpisodes may happen every few days, every few weeks or every few months, for some happening at common uniform times, typically mornings. For other affected people, there is not a pattern in time that can be recognized. Some with the condition have a warning of an episodic attack; they may experience a prodrome, some documented prodromal symptoms include: unusually intense nausea and pallor, excess salivation, sweating, flushing, rapid/irregular heartbeat, diarrhea, anxiety/panic, food aversion, restlessness/insomnia, irritability, depersonalization, fatigue/listlessness, intense feelings of being hot or chilled, intense thirst, shivering/shaking, retching, tachypnea, abdominal pain/cramping, limb paresthesias, hyperesthesia, photophobia, phonophobia, headache, and dyspnea, heightened sensitivity, especially to light, though sensitivity to smell, sound, pressure, and temperature, as well as oncoming muscle pain and fatigue, are also reported by some patients. Many experiences a full panic attack when nausea begins and continue to panic once the vomiting has begun. Medications like Lorazepam, Alprazolam, and other benzodiazepines are prescribed by their doctors and instructed to take immediately at the onset of any of their CVS symptoms and/or triggers. Some prodromal symptoms are present inter-episodically as well as during acute phases of illness. The majority of affected people can identify triggers that may precede an attack. The most common are various foods, infections (such as colds), menstruation, extreme physical exertion, lack of sleep, and psychological stresses, both positive and negative.[citation needed]\n\nAn affected person may also be light-sensitive (photophobic), sound-sensitive (phonophobic) or, less frequently, temperature- or pressure-sensitive during an attack.  Some people also have a strong urge to bathe in warm or cold water. In fact, many people with CVS experience a compulsion to be submerged in hot water, and end up taking several baths during the duration of an episode. For some the psychological compulsion to be in hot water is so extreme that they cannot stop themselves from taking very long baths in near scalding hot water several times per day. For some of these people, they may have just finished taking a lengthy bath in extremely hot water and immediately feel this compulsion again and end up taking another bath right after drying off. Some people with the condition experience insomnia, diarrhea (GI complications), hot and cold flashes, and excessive sweating before an episode. Some report that they experience a restless sensation or stinging pain along the spine, hands, and feet followed by weakness in both legs. Some of these symptoms may be due to dehydration or hypokalemia from excessive vomiting, rather than the underlying cause of CVS.",
                "epidemiology": "The average age at onset is 3\u20137 years, with described cases as young as 6 days and as old as 73 years. Typical delay in diagnosis from onset of symptoms is 3 years. Females show a slight predominance over males.\n\nOne study found that 3 in 100,000 five-year-olds are diagnosed with the condition. Two studies on childhood CVS suggest nearly 2% of school-age children may have CVS."

It is characterized by multiple and concurrent seizure types including tonic seizure, cognitive dysfunction, and slow spike waves on electroencephalogram (EEG), which are very abnormal. Typically, it presents in children aged 3\u20135 years and most of the time persists into adulthood with slight changes in the electroclinical phenotype. It has been associated with perinatal injuries, congenital infections, brain malformations, brain tumors, genetic disorders such as tuberous sclerosis and numerous gene mutations. Sometimes LGS is observed after infantile epileptic spasm syndrome. The prognosis for LGS is marked by a 5% mortality in childhood and persistent seizures into adulthood.",

                "symptoms": "The symptoms vary and progress with age and are characterized by a triad of seizures including tonic seizure, cognitive dysfunction, and EEG findings. The triad may not fully emerge until 1\u20132 years after first seizure episode.\n\nSeizures\nThe peak age of onset of seizures is in the first year of life and the seizures evolve into LGS typically between 3 and 5 years of age. The mainstay symptoms are seizures that are frequent \u2013 occurring daily and difficult to treat with anti-seizure medications. An estimated 30% of patients with infantile epileptic spasm syndrome (formerly called West syndrome) have been reported to progress with LGS.\n\nTonic seizures are the most common and present in nearly everyone with LGS. They occur most frequently during non-REM sleep (90% of the time). They initially last for a minute or less and are activated by sleep. The presentation can be subtle. They present often as tonic eyelid opening with some changes in breathing coupled with pupillary dilation, urinary incontinence, increased heart rate, and flushing.[citation needed]\n\nNonconvulsive status epilepticus occurs in about 50% of patients with LGS. The seizures can cause sudden falling often leading to injury. These \"drop attacks\" are typically the first manifestation of LGS. The attacks are characterized by a single, generalized myoclonic jerk that precedes tonic contraction of axial muscles.[citation needed]\n\nEEG findings\nFindings that strongly suggest LGS include abnormal, consistent slow spike-wave (< 3 hertz [Hz]) on awake EEG. The complexes typically consist of a spike (duration < 70 milliseconds) or a sharp wave (70\u2013200 milliseconds), followed first by a positive deep trough, then a negative wave (350\u2013400 milliseconds). Not every wave is preceded by a spike. Bursts increase and decrease without clear onset and offset.  Slow spike waves may occur during seizures or between seizures, or may occur in absence of any observable clinical changes. This helps distinguish LGS from the pattern of extended 3-Hz spike-wave discharges.[citation needed]",
                "epidemiology": "LGS is seen in approximately 4% of children with epilepsy, and is more common in males than in females. Usual onset is between the ages of three and five. Children can have no neurological problems prior diagnosis, or have other forms of epilepsy. West syndrome is diagnosed in 20% of patients before it evolves into LGS at about 2 years old.\n\nFinland\nAccording to a 1997 community-based retrospective study in the Helsinki metropolitan area and the province of Uusimaa, the annual incidence of Lennox\u2013Gastaut was 2 in 100,000 (0.002%) from 1975 to 1985.\n\nUnited States\n0.026% of all children in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area were estimated to have LGS in 1997, which was defined as, \"onset of multiple seizure types before age 11 years, with at least one seizure type resulting in falls, and an EEG demonstrating slow spike-wave complexes (<2.5 Hz).\" The study concluded that LGS accounts for 4% of childhood epilepsies."

These include weakness of one side of the body (hemiparesis), loss of vision for one side of the visual field (hemianopia), and cognitive difficulties (affecting learning, memory or language, for example). Epileptic seizures are also a major part of the illness, although these are often partial. Focal motor seizures or epilepsia partialis continua are particularly common, and may be very difficult to control with drugs.[citation needed]\n\nIn the chronic or residual stage, the inflammation is no longer active, but the affected individual is left with some or all of the symptoms because of the damage that the inflammation has caused.

It is caused by a problem with how the body breaks down certain large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (also known as GAGs or mucopolysaccharides). In children with this condition, these sugar molecules build up in the body and eventually lead to damage of the central nervous system and other organ systems.",
                "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanfilippo_syndrome",
                "symptoms": "The age of onset, severity, and progression of the disease can vary greatly between patients with different subtypes and within the same subtype. Development during the prenatal and early post-natal stages progresses normally.[citation needed] Between the ages of one and four is when the disease typically manifests. Affected infants appear normal, although some mild facial dysmorphism may be noticeable. Of all of the MPS diseases, Sanfilippo syndrome produces the fewest physical abnormalities. Possible clinical somatic symptoms, although rare, include coarse facial features with broad eyebrows, dark eyelashes, dry and rough hair, and skeletal pathology that affects growth.\n\nAfter an initial symptom-free interval, symptoms may arise during the early years of development, from the age of one to three. Children usually present with delayed cognitive development and/or behavioral problems, followed by progressive intellectual decline resulting in severe dementia and progressive motor disease. Acquisition of speech is often slow and incomplete. Even though delayed cognitive development may occur, it tends to be mild in individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome.\n\nBetween the ages of three and ten, the disease progresses to increasing behavioral disturbance including temper tantrums, hyperactivity, destructive behavior, aggressive behavior, pica, difficulties with toilet training, and sleep disturbance. As affected children initially have normal muscle strength and mobility, the behavioral disturbances may be difficult to manage. The disordered sleep in particular presents a significant problem to care providers. People with this disorder may stay in this phase for five to ten years. After that, their behavior subsides, but patients start to become increasingly immobile and unresponsive as individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome will gradually lose their motor skills, often require wheelchairs, and develop swallowing difficulties and seizures. Persons with Sanfilippo Syndrome tend to regress to an unresponsive or vegetative state until they pass away, which can occur anywhere between early teen years and their seventies. The life-span of a severely affected person does not usually extend beyond late teens to early twenties. However, persons with less severe phenotypes of the disease have varied life spans, some cases surviving into their seventies.\n\nThe most common symptoms seen in individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are neurological and may include intellectual disabilities, impaired language development, abnormal movements, and trouble sleeping; however, other symptoms commonly seen are excessive hair growth, chronic ear infections, respiratory infections, and poor nutrient absorption. Other signs less frequently seen in persons with Sanfilippo syndrome include behavioral changes and musculoskeletal changes such as increased muscle and joint stiffness and changes in bone growth or density.\n\nChildren with Sanfilippo syndrome often have an increased tolerance to pain. Bumps, bruises, or ear infections that would be painful for other children often go unnoticed in children with Sanfilippo syndrome. Some children with Sanfilippo syndrome may have a blood-clotting problem during and after surgery.\n\nIndividuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are born within normal physiological ranges. At around age 2, individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome are significantly taller than children without. By the age of 4, mostly male children with Sanfilippo syndrome were still taller than children without. Growth velocity decelerates dramatically after the age of 5, and by the time children with Sanfilippo syndrome reach 17, all individuals are significantly shorter than their reference groups.\n\nIt is difficult to clinically distinguish symptomatical differences among the four types of Sanfilippo syndrome. Although, each of the types can vary in severity. Type A is usually the most severe subtype, characterized by earliest onset, rapid clinical progression with severe symptoms, and short survival with patients averaging between 15 and 18 years old. Type B is considered slightly less aggressive than type A, but still display rapid clinical progression, and short survival with patients averaging between 17 and 19 years old. Type C is considered the less aggressive form of Sanfilippo syndrome with a patient's average life expectancy between 19 and 34 years of age, depending on the study. Type D is a rare subtype of Sanfilippo syndrome and no data has been published on average life expectancy.",
                "epidemiology": "It is estimated that approximately 1 in 70,000 newborns are born with Sanfilippo syndrome. The point prevalence (the proportion of people in a population that has the trait at a given point of time) can vary from 1 to 9 in 1,000,000 people. Sanfilippo syndrome varies geographically, with approximately 1 case per 280,000 live births in Northern Ireland, 1 per 66,000 in Australia, and 1 per 50,000 in the Netherlands. Globally, there are an estimated 12,000 to 19,000 individuals living with types A, B, and C. Subtypes A and B are predominately found in Europe, with subtype A specific to the northern region and subtype B specific to the southern region.\n\nStudies were performed across several countries assessing the mean age of diagnosis for each type of Sanfilippo syndrome. For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type A, mean age at diagnosis was found to between 3.5 and 4.9 years of age. For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B, mean age at diagnosis was found to be between 3.5 and 4.9 years of age. For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type C, mean age at diagnosis was found to be between 4.5 and 19 years of age. For patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type D, mean age at diagnosis was found to be between 8.2 and 8.3 years of age.\n\nWorldwide, Sanfilippo syndrome Type A and B affects the most people with Types C and D seen less commonly; however, the actual number of persons affected may be more than reported due to incorrect or delayed diagnosis of the disorder. An Australian study estimated the following incidences for each subtype of Sanfilippo syndrome in the Australian population:\n\nOver 50% of individual with Sanfilippo syndrome type A's die from pneumonia. The remaining causes of death for type A are spread out between cardiorespiratory failure, gastrointestinal complications, central nervous system complications, and other. Pneumonia is also the primary cause of death for Sanfilippo syndrome type B. Over 30% of individuals with Sanfilippo syndrome type B die from pneumonia. The remaining causes of death for type B are spread out between cardiorespiratory failure, gastrointestinal complications and other. Due to the rarity of Sanfilippo syndrome type C and D, not enough data was collected to estimate mortality rates."

                "description": "Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD) is a mental disorder in children and adolescents characterized by a persistently irritable or angry mood and frequent temper outbursts that are disproportionate to the situation and significantly more severe than the typical reaction of same-aged peers. DMDD was added to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) as a type of depressive disorder diagnosis for youths. The symptoms of DMDD resemble many other disorders, thus a differential includes attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), anxiety disorders, and childhood bipolar disorder, intermittent explosive disorder (IED), major depressive disorder (MDD), and conduct disorder.",
                "symptoms": "Children with DMDD show severe and recurrent temper outbursts three or more times per week. These outbursts can be verbal or behavioral. Verbal outbursts are often described by observers as \"rages\", \"fits\", or \"tantrums\". Temper outbursts will vary between children in type, nature, and setting, so it is important to talk with parents about the nature of the outburst and their triggers. Unlike the irritability that can be a symptom of other childhood disorders, such as oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), anxiety disorders, and major depressive disorder (MDD), the irritability displayed by children with DMDD is not episodic or situation-dependent. In DMDD, the irritability or anger is severe and is shown most of the day, nearly every day in multiple settings, lasting for one or more years. In other words, it is important to discern between general irritability and tantrums that can be episodic and common in pediatric patients and the easy provocation and extreme anger expressions of threatening to kill, throwing things, or attacking someone, as seen in DMDD. While all children may experience irritability and frustration, children with DMDD have difficulty controlling the level of anger and have reactions out of proportion to the situation. For instance, a child with DMDD can become extremely upset or emotional to the point of intense temper outbursts with yelling or hitting after being asked by a parent to stop playing and complete their homework. These levels of outbursts occur multiple times per week.\n\nFurthermore, most children with DMDD display symptoms that meet the criteria of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a smaller portion of children with ADHD will display symptoms similar to DMDD. Originally, a distinctive disorder from which DMDD was derived, called Severe Mood Dysregulation Disorder (SMDD), had the requirement for at least three \"hyperarousal\" symptoms, such as pressured speech, racing thoughts, intrusive behavior, distractibility, insomnia, and agitation, but these are not included in the most recent DMDD criteria.\n\nComorbidity\nThe core features of DMDD\u2014temper outbursts and chronic irritability\u2014are sometimes seen in children and adolescents with other psychiatric conditions. However, in children with DMDD, comorbidities with other psychiatric disorders appear to be extremely common as well as the range of disorders that can co-occur. Common comorbidities of DMDD include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), MDD, anxiety disorders, conduct disorder, and substance use disorders.\n\nADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by problems with inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity. ADHD is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that are pervasive, impairing in multiple contexts, and age-inappropriate.  ADHD also associated with impaired executive functioning, structural and functional abnormalities in brain parts, such as frontal-striatal, with specific gene mutation. Patients with DMDD often exhibit symptoms of ADHD due to their inattention and distractibility. \"Previous studies have found an association between frequent and consistent irritability during early adolescence and the development of ADHD in late adolescence\".\n\nMDD is a mood disorder characterized by daily or nearly daily symptoms of down or depressed mood for all or almost all the day. The DSM-V requires an individual meets 5 of 9 criteria for at least the past 2 weeks that cause significant impairment in daily life and are not caused by other medical conditions or substance use. MDD often presents differently when comparing children and adults. Young children between 3 and 8 years old present with somatic complaints (such as stomach aches), more irritability, symptoms of anxiety, general behavioral problems, and less of the typical sadness commonly seen in adults. Similar to ADHD, developing MDD in early adulthood was found to be linked with persistent irritability during early adolescence, which can be seen in DMDD.\n\nAnxiety disorders are a broad category of disorders. They are all generally characterized by excessive fear (emotional response to a real or perceived imminent threat) and anxiety (the anticipation of a future threat). The objects or situations that are the sources of the fear and anxiety a person experiences, which can often lead to avoidant behavior, are used to characterize the different anxiety disorders. With DMDD, the severe mood dysregulation is associated with higher rates of anxiety and depressive disorders in the future.\n\nConduct disorder is a behavior disorder characterized by repeated, persistent patterns of behavior that violate the rights of others and disregard major societal norms and rules. While both DMDD and conduct disorder are associated with argumentative and defiant behavior, DMDD is distinctly differentiated from conduct disorder by the DSM-V. Individuals with DMDD experience severe emotional dysregulation not seen in conduct disorder. Additionally, conduct disorder is described by a distinct lack of remorse and repeated physical harm and threats of harm to people and/or animals. Evidence of conduct disorder during childhood is one of the criteria for an adult diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder; however, adults with a continued diagnosis of conduct disorder do not necessarily have antisocial personality disorder.\n\nSubstance use disorders (SUD) encompass a broad range of specific diagnoses, but they all generally have the characteristics of cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms that cause someone to continue to use a substance despite significant impairment. One salient feature of SUDs is that they change the brain circuitry in such a way that the changes can persist beyond detoxification. In general, though, examining the comorbidity of SUDs in DMDD is important as it may be linked to self-medication for underlying mood disorders or trauma. However, while there are reports in community and clinical samples of comorbidity for SUDs with DMDD, there has been no formal examination of this link.",
                "epidemiology": "There are no good estimates of the prevalence of DMDD, but primary studies have found a rate of 0.8\u20133.3% and a literature review estimated about 1.6% prevalence rate in children under the age of 13 years old. Epidemiological studies show that approximately 3.2% of children in the community have chronic problems with irritability and temper, the essential features of DMDD. These problems are probably more common among clinic-referred youths. Parents report that approximately 30% of children hospitalized for psychiatric problems meet diagnostic criteria for DMDD; 15% meet criteria based on the observations of hospital staff."

In atypical form the spasms start in the cheekbone area and spreads to the eyelid. Ultimately, all the muscles on that side are affected, nearly all the time. This sometimes causes the mouth to be pulled to the side. Experts have linked hemifacial spasm to facial nerve injury, Bell's palsy and tumors.

Attacks may also alternate from one side of the body to the other, or alternate between affecting one or both sides during a single attack. Besides hemiplegia, symptoms of the disorder include an extremely broad range of neurological and developmental impairments which are not well understood. Normally, hemiplegia and other associated symptoms cease completely with sleep, but they may recur upon waking.",
                "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_hemiplegia_of_childhood",
                "symptoms": "AHC patients exhibit a wide range of symptoms in addition to hemiplegic attacks. These can be further characterized as paroxysmal and non-paroxysmal symptoms. Paroxysmal symptoms are generally associated with hemiplegic attacks and may occur suddenly with hemiplegia or on their own. Paroxysmal symptoms may last for variable amounts of time. Non-paroxysmal symptoms tend to be side effects of AHC which are present at all times, not just during episodes or attacks. Epilepsy, which is also considered a paroxysmal symptom, plays an important role in the progression and diagnosis of AHC.[citation needed]\n\nHemiplegic attacks\nChronologically, hemiplegic attacks are not always the first symptom of AHC, but they are the most prominent symptom, as well as the symptom for which the disorder is named. Hemiplegic attacks may affect one or both sides of the body, and attacks which affect both sides of the body may be referred to as either bilateral or quadriplegic attacks. One of the unique characteristics of AHC is that hemiplegic attacks, as well as other symptoms which may co-occur with hemiplegia, cease immediately upon sleep. During strong attacks, the symptoms may reoccur upon waking. Hemiplegic attacks can occur suddenly or gradually, and the severity of an attack can vary over its duration. The attacks may alternate from one side of the body to another, though this is rare. The length of attacks may also vary from minutes to weeks, though the length of attacks varies more greatly between people than between attacks for one person. Both bilateral and hemiplegic attacks are associated with pseudobulbar features such as dysphagia, dysarthria, and respiratory difficulty. Paralysis is also often accompanied by changes in skin color and temperature, sweating, restlessness, tremor, screaming, and the appearance of pain. Hemiplegic attacks happen irregularly and can occur with speech, eating, and swallowing impairment. Patients with AHC are frequently underweight due to these side effects. The average age of onset for hemiplegic episodes has been found to be 6\u20137 months of age. This early onset gives the name of this disorder the slightly misleading ending \"of childhood\". AHC is not exclusively limited to childhood \u2013 attacks in some cases become milder after the first ten years of life, but they never completely disappear.\n\nParoxysmal symptoms\nAHC patients have exhibited various paroxysmal symptoms which manifest to different degrees in each person. Paroxysmal symptoms include tonic, tonic\u2013clonic, or myoclonic limb movements, dystonic posturing, choreoathetosis, ocular nystagmus, and various other ocular motor abnormalities. Almost half of all people have dystonic symptoms prior to experiencing hemiplegia. These symptoms generally begin before 8 months of age. Ocular motor abnormalities occur early, and these are the most frequent early symptoms of AHC, particularly nystagmus. Almost 1/3 of people with this disorder had episodic ocular motor features within 1\u20132 days of birth. Many also experienced hemiplegia and dystonia before 3 months of age. A final symptom that may be considered paroxysmal is a temporary change in behavior - some patients will become unreasonable, demanding, and aggressive either before or after an attack.\n\nNot all patients have all of these symptoms, and it is not known whether they are caused by AHC. Symptoms usually manifest in the first 3 months of the child's life, with an average onset of 2.5 months. Frequently, some of these symptoms will manifest in the neonatal period. These paroxysmal symptoms are often used to help diagnose AHC, since there is no simple test for it.[citation needed]\n\nIn some cases, EEGs taken during these paroxysmal events were characterized by a generalized background slowing. Overall however, EEG during episodes and other investigative methods such as brain MRI, TACs, angiographic MRIs and CFS have normal results.\n\nNon-paroxysmal symptoms\nIn the long term, many paroxysmal symptoms occur along with AHC, and while these symptoms vary in strength depending on the person, they are consistent features of AHC. It is thought that some of these symptoms are brought on or worsened by hemiplegic attacks, though it is not known for certain. Patients experience persistent motor, movement (ataxia), and cognitive deficits. These deficits become more apparent over time and include developmental delays, social problems, and retardation. It is rare for someone with AHC not to have cognitive deficits, but a study in Japan did find two patients who met all of the diagnostic criteria for AHC but who were not mentally impaired. It is not known whether AHC is a progressive disease, but severe attacks are suspected to cause damage which results in permanent loss of function. 100% of children studied in the USA have had some form of mental impairment, which is usually described as mild to moderate, but varies greatly among individuals.\n\nEpilepsy\nAt least 50% of people with AHC also have epilepsy, and AHC is often misdiagnosed as epilepsy because of this. These epileptic events are distinguished from other episodes by an alteration of consciousness, as well as frequent tonic or tonic\u2013clonic activity. Epileptic episodes are generally rare, though they do increase with age. Due to the rarity of epileptic episodes, there are few EEG confirmations of them.[citation needed]"

Other symptoms include drooping of the eyebrow, a change in taste, and pain around the ear. Typically symptoms come on over 48 hours. Bell's palsy can trigger an increased sensitivity to sound known as hyperacusis.",

                "symptoms": "Bell's palsy is characterized by a one-sided facial droop that comes on within 72 hours. In rare cases (<1%), it can occur on both sides resulting in total facial paralysis.\n\nThe facial nerve controls a number of functions, such as blinking and closing the eyes, smiling, frowning, lacrimation, salivation, flaring nostrils and raising eyebrows. It also carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, through the chorda tympani nerve (a branch of the facial nerve). Because of this, people with Bell's palsy may present with loss of taste sensation in the anterior 2\u20443 of the tongue on the affected side.\n\nAlthough the facial nerve innervates the stapedius muscle of the middle ear (through the tympanic branch), sound sensitivity, causing normal sounds to be perceived as very loud (hyperacusis), and dysacusis are possible but hardly ever clinically evident.",
                "epidemiology": "The number of new cases of Bell's palsy ranges from about one to four cases per 10,000 population per year. The rate increases with age. Bell's palsy affects about 40,000 people in the United States every year. It affects approximately 1 person in 65 during a lifetime.\n\nA range of annual incidence rates have been reported in the literature: 15, 24, and 25\u201353 (all rates per 100,000 population per year). Bell's palsy is not a reportable disease, and there are no established registries for people with this diagnosis, which complicates precise estimation.\n\nFrequency\nAbout 40,000 people are affected by Bell's Palsy in the United States every year. It can affect anyone of any gender and age, but its incidence seems to be highest in those in the 15- to 45-year-old age group."

                "description": "Witzelsucht is a set of rare neurological symptoms characterized by a tendency to make puns, or tell inappropriate jokes or pointless stories in socially inappropriate situations. It makes one unable to read sarcasm.",
                "link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witzelsucht",
                "symptoms": "Case studies\nA condition rarely diagnosed, Witzelsucht has been well documented in the recent era in at least two cases:\n\nCase #1: A 30-year-old, right-handed man was admitted to the department of neurology for irritability, inappropriate behavior, and morbid hyperphagia with obesity. His inappropriate laughter and persistent pun and joke telling was a sharp contrast to his personality as an intellectual theological scholar, known for his exceptional memory as opposed to his sense of humor. This behavior was generally prompted by environmental stimuli such as physician\u2019s rounds or blood sampling. To the patient, his behavior seemed normal, which explains why he remained nondiscriminating toward his jokes, their context, and their impression on those around him. Neurological examination revealed mild spastic left hemiparesis with minimal motor coordination and impairment of voluntary fine movements. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed hypoperfusion, or decreased blood flow, in the right frontoparietal area. Additionally, verbal and performance tests showed evidence of poor concentration skills, high distractibility, and difficulty with visual-spatial tasks. The patient\u2019s performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was severely impaired, suggesting frontal dysfunction.\n\nCase #2: A 56-year-old man, KS, was admitted to the hospital with signs of a putaminal hemorrhage, including dense paralysis on the left side of his body and face, difficulty swallowing, and visual field defects on his left side. On the fifth day of hospitalization, he was alert and cooperative with no disorientation, delusion, or emotional lability. He then became euphoric and outspoken, speaking in puns and witticisms with an exaggerated smile. The content of his conversations, however, was not bizarre or random. He would work in puns and jokes while speaking his concerns about his other physical symptoms from the stroke in a coherent manner. Sometimes he would not crack a smile at something he said to make others around him laugh hysterically, while other times he could not appreciate others' jokes. During this time, KS also developed hypersexuality, using erotic words and inappropriate behavior toward the female hospital staff. Before his stroke, KS's family reported he did make jokes on occasion, but never in this bizarre manner, and never behaved impolitely to women. MRI tests showed bleeding at the right putamen, extending into the posterior and lateral portions of the right thalamus and defects in the thalamus and right basal ganglion. Another test showed deficits in recent memory, orientation, abstract thinking, drawing, and verbal fluency.\n\nAltered sense of humor\nIn both case studies, patients showed an altered sense of humor, mostly in regard to producing and appreciating humor. The right hemisphere is involved with processing speed and problem solving, which plays a role in humor processing. These patients have difficulty fully interpreting a joke's content, but can recognize the importance of the form of a joke. Patients with Witzelsucht often find non sequiturs, slapstick humor, and puns funniest since these forms of humor do not require integration of content across sentences[dubious \u2013 discuss]. In other words, the end of the joke is not dependent on the first part; one does not need to make a logical connection to understand humor. Patients show no change in understanding simple logic, and understand the importance of surprise in humor (hence why they choose slapstick humor instead of the \u201ccorrect\u201d punch line); however, once they have registered this surprise, they cannot connect the punch line to the body of the joke to fully appreciate the true humor behind the joke. Successful jokes require a juxtaposition of the sound and the meaning of words used to understand the punchline. However, patients with witzelsucht have difficulty connecting the two, resulting in an inability to appreciate humor.\n\nAdditionally, patients show no emotional reaction to humor, whether produced by themselves or others. This lack of responsiveness is due to dissociation between their cognitive and affective responses to humorous stimuli. That is, even when a patient understands that a joke is funny (based on quantitative brain activity), they do not respond with laughter, or even a smile. While they have grasped the cognitive basis of humor, they do not affectively respond. This is also considered a cognitive component of empathy, affecting one's ability to take the perspective of others; hence why patients often do not respond to humor produced by other people.\n\nHypersexuality\nThis symptom is much rarer than the unusual use of puns and nonresponsive sense of humor most notably seen in Witzelsucht patients. Nonetheless, patients can still exhibit hypersexuality by making sexual comments at socially inappropriate times. Some signs of this behavior include impulsivity, poor judgment, deficits in emotional regulation, excess preoccupation with sex, and cognitive rigidity (difficulty in appreciating another\u2019s emotion, inability to yield). More than likely this symptom is linked to amygdala damage that can occur during a stroke, which can also induce frontal lobe damage."

The syndrome often begins with a circumscribed patch of scleroderma in the frontal region of the scalp which is associated with a loss of hair and the appearance of a depressed linear scar extending down through the midface on the affected side. This scar is referred to as a \"coup de sabre\" lesion because it resembles the scar of a wound made by a sabre, and is indistinguishable from the scar observed in frontal linear scleroderma.\n\nIn 20% of cases, the hair and skin overlying affected areas may become hyperpigmented or hypopigmented with patches of unpigmented skin.
